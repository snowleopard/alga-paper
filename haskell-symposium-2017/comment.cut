  I would like to thank Arseniy Alekseyev and Neil Mitchell
  for numerous discussions on algebraic graphs, their advice,
  criticism and encouragement. Without their help this work would
  have likely remained an unfinished toy project.
  Simon Peyton Jones, Brent Yorgey, Danil Sokolov, Ben Lippmeier, Ulan Degenbaev
  and several anonymous reviewers provided constructive feedback on an
  earlier draft of this paper, helping to substantially improve it. Last but
  not least, I'm very grateful to Victor Khomenko for his contribution to the
  algebra of parameterised graphs that forms the mathematical foundation of this work.
