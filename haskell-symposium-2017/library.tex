\section{Graph Transformation Library}\label{sec-transformations}

As shown in the previous section~\S\ref{sec-a-la-carte}, the world of \hs{Graph}
instances has many inhabitants sharing a part of their `algebraic DNA'. They all
can benefit from a library of polymorphic graph construction and transformation,
which we develop in this section. The API of the library is summarised in
Fig.~\ref{fig-api}. The part shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-api}(a) has been defined
in~\S\ref{sec-algebra}.

\subsection{Standard Families of Graphs}\label{sub-families}

This subsection defines a few simple functions for constructing graphs from
standard graph families. See Fig.~\ref{fig-api}(b) for the list of all functions
we define.

A \emph{path} on a list of vertices can be constructed from the \hs{edges}
formed by the path neighbours:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
path :: Graph g => [Vertex g] -> g
path [@@]  = empty
path [x] = vertex x
path xs  = edges $ @\std{zip}@ xs (@\std{tail}@ xs)
\end{minted}

\noindent
Note that the case with a single vertex on the path requires a special treatment.

If we connect the last vertex of a path to the first one, we get a \emph{circuit}
graph, or a \emph{cycle}. Let us express this in terms of the \hs{path} function:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
circuit :: Graph g => [Vertex g] -> g
circuit [@@] = empty
circuit xs = path (xs ++ [head xs])
\end{minted}

A \emph{star} graph can be obtained by connecting a centre vertex to a given
list of leaves:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
star :: Graph g => Vertex g -> [Vertex g] -> g
star x ys = connect (vertex x) (vertices ys)
\end{minted}

Finally, \emph{trees} and \emph{forests} can be constructed by the following
pair of mutually recursive functions:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
tree :: Graph g => Tree (Vertex g) -> g
tree (Node r f) = star@\,\blk{r}\,@(@\std{map}\,\blk{rootLabel}\,\blk{f}@)@\,@`overlay`@\,\blk{forest}\,f@

forest :: Graph g => Forest (Vertex g) -> g
forest = @\std{foldr}@ overlay empty . @\std{map}@ tree
\end{minted}

\noindent
That is, a tree is represented by the root star overlaid with the forest
of subtrees of the root's descendants. We remind the reader the
definitions of the data types \hs{Tree} and \hs{Forest} from the
\textsf{containers} library for completeness:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
data Tree a = Node { rootLabel :: a
                   , subForest :: Forest a }
\end{minted}
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
type Forest a = [Tree a]
\end{minted}

Below we experiment with these functions and their properties, and define
graphs \hs{pentagon} and \hs{p4} that will be used in subsection~\S\ref{sub-functor}
and in particular will feature in Fig.~\ref{fig-product}. The helper function
\hs{edgeList} is defined as \hs{edgeList = Set.toList . relation}.

\begin{minted}[frame=single,fontsize=\small]{haskell}
@\ghci@ pentagon = circuit [1..5]
@\ghci@ p4 = path "abcd"

@\ghci@ :t pentagon
@\blk{pentagon}@ :: (Graph g,@\,@Num (Vertex g),@\,@Enum (Vertex g)) => g

@\ghci@ isSubgraphOf (path [1..5]) (pentagon :: Relation Int)
True

@\ghci@ edgeList p4
[('a','b'),('b','c'),('c','d')]

@\ghci@ t = Node 1 [Node 2 [], Node 3 [Node 4 [], Node 5 []]]
@\ghci@ edgeList (tree t)
[(1,2),(1,3),(3,4),(3,5)]

@\ghci@ p4 == (clique "abcd" :: Transitive Char)
True
\end{minted}

The last property deserves a remark: the transitive closure of a path graph
is the directed clique on the same set of vertices, therefore they are considered equal
by the \hs{Transitive} graph instance.

\subsection{Graph Transpose}

In the rest of this section we present a toolbox for transforming polymorphic graph
expressions. The functions in the presented toolbox are listed in Fig.~\ref{fig-api}(c).

One of the simplest transformations one can apply to a graph is to flip the
direction of all of its edges. Transpose is usually straightforward to implement but
whichever data structure you use to represent graphs, you will spend at least
$O(1)$ time to modify it (say, by flipping the \hs{treatAsTransposed} flag);
much more often you will have to traverse the data structure and flip every edge,
resulting in $O(|V|+|E|)$ time complexity. However, by working with polymorphic
graphs, i.e. graphs of type \hs{forall g. Graph g => g}, and using Haskell's
zero-cost \hs{newtype} wrappers, we can implement transpose that takes zero time.

Consider the following \hs{Graph} instance:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
newtype Transpose g = T { transpose :: g } deriving Eq
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
instance Graph g => Graph (Transpose g) where
    type Vertex (Transpose g) = Vertex g
    empty       = T empty
    vertex      = T . vertex
    overlay x y = T $ overlay@\,@(transpose x)@\,@(transpose y)
    connect x y = T $ connect@\,@(transpose y)@\,@(transpose x)
\end{minted}

\noindent
That is, we wrap a graph in a \hs{newtype} flipping the order of \hs{connect} arguments.
Let us check if this works:

\begin{minted}[frame=single,fontsize=\small]{haskell}
@\ghci@ edgeList $ 1 * (2 + 3) * 4
[(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,4),(3,4)]

@\ghci@ edgeList $ transpose $ 1 * (2 + 3) * 4
[(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(4,2),(4,3)]
\end{minted}

The \hs{transpose} has zero runtime cost, because all we do is wrapping and unwrapping
the \hs{newtype}, which is guaranteed to be free or, to be more precise, is handled
by GHC at compile time.

To make sure \hs{transpose} is only applied to polymorphic graphs, we do not export
the constructor \hs{T}, therefore the only way to call \hs{transpose} is to give it a
polymorphic argument and let the type inference interpret it as a value of type
\hs{Transpose}.

\subsection{Graph Functor}\label{sub-functor}

We now implement a function \hs{gmap} that given a function \hs{a}~\hs{->}~\hs{b}
and a polymorphic graph whose vertices are of type \hs{a} will produce a
polymorphic graph with vertices of type \hs{b} by applying the function
to each vertex. This is almost a \hs{Functor} but it does not have the usual
type signature, because \hs{Graph} is not a higher-kinded type\footnote{It is
possible to define a higher-kinded version of \hs{Graph}, but it has
fewer instances.}:

\vspace{2mm}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
newtype GraphFunctor a =
    F { gfor@\,@::@\,\blk{forall}\,\blk{g}@.@\,@Graph g@\,@=>@\,@(a -> Vertex g)@\,@->@\,\blk{g}@ }
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
instance Graph (GraphFunctor a) where
    type Vertex (GraphFunctor a) = a
    empty       = F $ \_ -> empty
    vertex  x   = F $ \f -> vertex (f x)
    overlay x y = F $ \f -> overlay@\,@(gmap f x)@\,@(gmap f y)
    connect x y = F $ \f -> connect@\,@(gmap f x)@\,@(gmap f y)
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
gmap :: Graph@\,\blk{g}@ => (a -> Vertex@\,\blk{g}@) -> GraphFunctor@\,\blk{a}@ -> g
gmap = flip gfor
\end{minted}

Essentially, we are defining another \hs{newtype} wrapper, which pushes the
given function all the way towards the vertices of a given graph expression.
This has no runtime cost,
just as before, although the actual evaluation of the given function at each
vertex will not be free, of course. Here is \hs{gmap} in action:

\begin{minted}[frame=single,fontsize=\small]{haskell}
@\ghci@ edgeList $ 1 * 2 * 3 + 4 * 5
[(1,2),(1,3),(2,3),(4,5)]

@\ghci@ edgeList $ gmap (+1) $ 1 * 2 * 3 + 4 * 5
[(2,3),(2,4),(3,4),(5,6)]
\end{minted}
\vspace{-1mm}
As you can see, we can increment the value of each vertex by mapping the function
\hs{(+1)} over the graph. The resulting expression is a polymorphic graph, as desired.
Note that \hs{gmap} satisfies the functor laws
\hs{gmap id = id} and \hs{gmap f@ . @}\hs{gmap g@ = @}\hs{gmap (f . g)}, because
it does not change the structure of the given expression and only pushes
the given function down to its leaves -- the vertices.

An alert reader might wonder: what happens if the function maps two different
vertices into the same one? They will be merged. Merging graph vertices is
a useful graph transformation, so let us define it in terms of \hs{gmap}:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
mergeVertices :: Graph g => (Vertex g -> Bool)
    -> Vertex g -> GraphFunctor (Vertex g) -> g
mergeVertices p v = gmap $ \u -> if p u then v else u
\end{minted}
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{minted}[frame=single,fontsize=\small]{haskell}
@\ghci@ edgeList $ mergeVertices odd 3 $ 1 * 2 * 3 + 4 * 5
[(2,3),(3,2),(3,3),(4,3)]
\end{minted}
\vspace{-1mm}
The function takes a predicate on graph vertices and a target vertex and
maps all vertices satisfying the predicate into the target, thereby
merging them. In our example the \hs{odd} vertices $\{1, 3, 5\}$ are merged
into~3, in particular creating the self-loop $3 \rightarrow 3$. Note: it takes
linear time $O(|g|)$ for \hs{mergeVertices} to traverse the graph and apply the
predicate to each vertex (where $|g|$ is the size of the graph expression $g$),
which may be much more efficient than merging vertices in a concrete data
structure. For example, if the graph is represented by an adjacency matrix, it
will likely be necessary to rebuild the resulting matrix from scratch, which
takes $O(|V|^2)$ time. Since for many graphs we have $|g| = O(|V|)$, our
\hs{mergeVertices} may be quadratically faster than the matrix-based one.

\begin{figure*}
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{fig/graph-product.pdf}}
\caption{The Cartesian graph product of \hs{pentagon} and \hs{p4}.\label{fig-product}}
\end{figure*}

As another application of \hs{gmap}, we implement the \emph{Cartesian graph
product} operation \hs{box}, or $G~~\square~~H$, where the resulting vertex set is
$V_G \times V_H$ and vertex $(x, y)$ is connected to vertex $(x', y')$ if
either $x = x'$ and $(y, y') \in E_H$, or $y = y'$ and $(x,x')\in E_G$. An example of the Cartesian product of graphs \hs{pentagon}
and \hs{p4} is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-product}.

\begin{minted}{haskell}
box :: (Graph g, Vertex g @\teq@ (a, b))
    => GraphFunctor a -> GraphFunctor b -> g
box x y = @\std{foldr}@ overlay empty $ xs ++ ys
  where
    xs = @\std{map}@ (\b -> gmap (,b) x) . toList $ gmap id y
    ys = @\std{map}@ (\a -> gmap (a,) y) . toList $ gmap id x
\end{minted}

The Cartesian product $G~~\square~~H$ is assembled by creating $|V_H|$ copies
of graph $G$ and overlaying them with $|V_G|$ copies of graph $H$. We get
access to the list of graph vertices using \hs{toList} and turn vertices of
original graphs into pairs of vertices by \hs{gmap}. Note that we need to
\emph{reinterpret} the input of type \hs{GraphFunctor} as a polymorphic graph
by \hs{gmap@\,id@} before passing it to the \hs{toList} function, which expects
inputs of type \hs{ToList}. As you can see, we managed to implement quite
a sophisticated graph transformation function \hs{box} fully polymorphically.
One can go further up in layers of abstraction and use \hs{box} to construct
\emph{mesh} and \emph{torus} graphs as
\hs{mesh xs ys = box (path xs) (path ys)} and
\hs{torus xs ys = box (circuit xs) (circuit ys)}, respectively.

The \hs{toList} function is implemented as follows:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
newtype ToList a = L { toList :: [a] }
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
instance Graph (ToList a) where
     type Vertex (ToList a) = a
     empty       = L $ [@@]
     vertex  x   = L $ [x]
     overlay x y = L $ toList x ++ toList y
     connect x y = L $ toList x ++ toList y
\end{minted}

\noindent
Note that we do not provide the \hs{Eq} instance for \hs{ToList}, because it
is impossible to make it law-abiding without requiring \hs{Eq} for vertices,
and we would like to avoid this in order to keep the \hs{box} type signature
fully parametric. As a consequence, \hs{toList (1 + 1)} produces the
list \hs{[1,1]}.

\subsection{Graph Monad}\label{sub-monad}

What do the operations of removing a vertex and splitting a vertex have in common?
They both can be implemented by replacing each vertex of a graph with a (possibly empty)
subgraph and flattening the result. You may recognise this as the \hs{bind} operation
of a monad. We implement \hs{bind} by wrapping it into yet another \hs{newtype}:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
newtype GraphMonad a =
    M { bind :: forall g. Graph g => (a -> g) -> g }
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
instance Graph (GraphMonad a) where
    type Vertex (GraphMonad a) = a
    empty       = M $ \_ -> empty
    vertex  x   = M $ \f -> f x
    overlay x y = M $ \f -> overlay@\,@(bind x f)@\,@(bind y f)
    connect x y = M $ \f -> connect@\,@(bind x f)@\,@(bind y f)
\end{minted}

The implementation is almost identical to \hs{gmap}: instead of
wrapping the value \hs{f@\,\,@x} into a \hs{vertex}, we should just leave it as is.
Let us see how we can make use of this new type in our toolbox.

Firstly, we are going to implement a \hs{@\std{filter}@}-like function \hs{induce}
that, given a vertex predicate and a graph, will compute the \emph{induced subgraph}
on the set of vertices that satisfy the predicate by turning all other
vertices into empty subgraphs and flattening the result.

\begin{minted}{haskell}
induce :: Graph g
    => (Vertex g -> Bool) -> GraphMonad (Vertex g) -> g
induce p g = bind g $
    \v -> if p v then vertex v else empty
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[frame=single,fontsize=\small]{haskell}
@\ghci@ edgeList $ induce (<3) $ clique [0..10]
[(0,1),(0,2),(1,2)]
\end{minted}

\noindent
As you can see, by inducing a clique on a subset of the vertices
that we like \hs{(<3)}, we get a smaller clique, as expected.
The cost of \hs{induce} for a given expression $g$ is $O(|g|)$.

Now we can implement the \hs{removeVertex} function:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
removeVertex :: (Graph g, Eq (Vertex g))
    => Vertex g -> GraphMonad (Vertex g) -> g
removeVertex v = induce (/= v)
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[frame=single,fontsize=\small]{haskell}
@\ghci@ edgeList $ removeVertex 2 $ 1 * 2 + 3 * 1
[(3,1)]
\end{minted}

The polymorphic implementation of \hs{removeVertex} presented above takes
$O(|g|)$ to remove a vertex from a graph expression $g$, which is
slower than some concrete graph data structures.

We can also use the \hs{bind} function to split a vertex into a list of given vertices:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
splitVertex :: (Graph@\,\,g@,@\,@Eq@\,@(Vertex@\,\,g@)) => Vertex@\,\,g@
    -> [Vertex@\,\,g@] -> GraphMonad@\,@(Vertex@\,\,g@) -> g
splitVertex v vs g = bind g $
    \u -> if u == v then vertices vs else vertex u
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[frame=single,fontsize=\small]{haskell}
@\ghci@ edgeList $ splitVertex 1 [0, 1] $ 1 * (2 + 3)
[(0,2),(0,3),(1,2),(1,3)]
\end{minted}

\noindent
Here vertex 1 is split into a pair of vertices $\{0, 1\}$ that have the same connectivity.

\subsection{Beyond Homomorphisms}\label{sub-beyond}

Most of the \hs{newtype} wrappers defined in this section are \emph{homomorphisms},
that is, they preserve the structure of the original graph expression. The two
exceptions are: \hs{Transpose}, which is an \emph{antihomomorphism}, and
\hs{ToList} which collapses the structure of the original expression into a list.

Below we derive an implementation for \hs{removeEdge}, which is another
example of a useful function that is not a homomorphism. Removing an edge sounds
easy, but the result is the most complicated \hs{newtype} in this paper.

\begin{figure*}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
            newtype RemoveEdge a = RE { re :: forall g. (Vertex g @\teq@ a, Graph g) => a -> a -> g }
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
            instance Eq a => Graph (RemoveEdge a) where
                type Vertex (RemoveEdge a) = a
                empty       = RE $ \_ _ -> empty
                vertex  x   = RE $ \_ _ -> vertex x
                overlay x y = RE $ \u v -> overlay (re x u v) (re y u v)
                connect x y = RE $ \u v -> connect (removeVertex u $ re x u u) (re y u v) `overlay`
                                           connect (re x u v) (removeVertex v $ re y v v)
\end{minted}
\vspace{0mm}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
            removeEdge :: (Eq (Vertex g), Graph g) => Vertex g -> Vertex g -> RemoveEdge (Vertex g) -> g
            removeEdge u v g = re g u v
\end{minted}
\caption{Removing an edge from a polymorphic graph.}
\end{figure*}

\noindent
Here is how it works. Removing an edge $(u,v)$ from the \hs{empty} graph
or a \hs{vertex} is easy:
nothing needs to be done, because there are no edges. To remove the edge from an
\hs{overlay}, we simply recurse to both subexpressions, because the overlay does not create
any edges. The \hs{connect} case $x \rightarrow y$ is handled by overlaying two graphs:
$x_u \rightarrow y_{uv}$ and $x_{uv} \rightarrow y_v$, where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_u = \hs{removeVertex}~u~x$ and $y_{uv} = \hs{removeEdge}~u~v~y$,
    thus $x_u \rightarrow y_{uv}$ definitely does not contain the edge $(u,v)$
    at the cost of losing the vertex $u$ in the left-hand side $x_u$.
    \item $y_v = \hs{removeVertex}~v~y$ and $x_{uv} = \hs{removeEdge}~u~v~x$,
    thus $x_{uv} \rightarrow y_v$ definitely does not contain the edge $(u,v)$
    at the cost of losing the vertex $v$ in the right-hand side $y_v$.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
The overlay $x_u \rightarrow y_{uv} + x_{uv} \rightarrow y_v$ contains the
vertices $u$ and $v$, because at least one copy of each vertex has been preserved,
but the edge $(u,v)$ is removed in both subexpressions as intended.

We demonstrate \hs{removeEdge} on two simple examples:
\begin{minted}[frame=single,fontsize=\small]{haskell}
@\ghci@ edgeList $ path "Hello"
[('H','e'),('e','l'),('l','l'),('l','o')]

@\ghci@ edgeList $ removeEdge 'H' 'e' $ path "Hello"
[('e','l'),('l','l'),('l','o')]

@\ghci@ edgeList $ removeEdge 'l' 'l' $ path "Hello"
[('H','e'),('e','l'),('l','o')]
\end{minted}

\noindent
The \hs{removeEdge} function is expensive: given an expression of size $|g|$
it may produce a transformed expression of the quadratic size $O(|g|^2)$. Many
concrete \hs{Graph} instances provide much faster equivalents of \hs{removeEdge}.

\vspace{-1mm}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{De Bruijn Graphs}

To demonstrate that one can easily construct sophisticated graphs using
the presented library, let us try it on \emph{De Bruijn graphs}, an interesting
combinatorial object that frequently shows up in computer engineering and
bioinformatics. The implementation is very short, but requires some explanation:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
deBruijn :: (Graph g,@\,@Vertex g @\teq@ [a])@\,@=>@\,@Int -> [a] -> g
deBruijn len alphabet = bind skeleton expand
  where
    overlaps = @\std{mapM}@ (@\std{const}@ alphabet) [2..len]
    skeleton = edges [@\,@(Left s,@\,@Right s) | s@\,@<-@\,\blk{overlaps}\,@]
    expand v = vertices
        [ @\std{either}@ ([a]++) (++[a]) v | a <- alphabet ]
\end{minted}

The function builds a De Bruijn graph of dimension \hs{len} from symbols of the given
\hs{alphabet}. The vertices of the graph are all possible words of length \hs{len}
containing symbols of the \hs{alphabet}, and two words are connected $x \rightarrow y$
whenever $x$ and $y$ match after we remove the first symbol of $x$ and the last symbol
of $y$ (equivalently, when $x = az$ and $y = zb$ for some symbols $a$ and $b$).
The process of construction of a 3-dimensional De Bruijn graph on the alphabet
$\{0, 1\}$ is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig-de-bruijn}. Here are all the ingredients
of the solution:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \hs{overlaps} contains all possible words of length \hs{len-1} that
    correspond to overlaps of connected vertices.
    \item \hs{skeleton} contains one edge per overlap, with \hs{Left} and
    \hs{Right} vertices acting as temporary placeholders.
    \item We replace a vertex \hs{Left@\,$s$@} with a subgraph of two vertices
    $\{0s, 1s\}$, i.e. the vertices whose suffix is $s$. Symmetrically,
    \hs{Right@\,$s$@} is replaced by vertices $\{s0, s1\}$. This is captured
    by the function \hs{expand}.
    \item The result is obtained by computing \hs{bind} \hs{skeleton} \hs{expand}.
\end{itemize}

Below we construct the De Bruijn graph shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-de-bruijn}.

Note that a De Bruijn graph of dimension \hs{len} on the \hs{alphabet} has
$|\hs{alphabet}|^{\hs{len}}$ vertices and $|\hs{alphabet}|^{\hs{len} + 1}$
edges.

\subsection{Summary}\label{sub-library-summary}

We have presented a library of polymorphic graph construction and
transformation functions that provide a flexible and elegant way to manipulate
graph expressions polymorphically. Polymorphic graphs are highly reusable
and composable, and can be interpreted using any of the \hs{Graph} instances
defined in~\S\ref{sec-a-la-carte}, as well as other instances provided by the
\textsf{algebraic-graphs} library that is available on Hackage.
The library is written in the vanilla functional programming style and has
no dependencies apart from core GHC libraries.
Many of the presented graph transformation algorithms are expressed using familiar
functional programming abstractions, such as functors and monads.
